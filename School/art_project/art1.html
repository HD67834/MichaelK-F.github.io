            <h1>Hieroglyphics</h1>
            
            Hieroglyphs are a pictographic alphabet that was used in ancient Egypt by scribes and royalty. Most ancient Egyptians could not read or write, so the scribes and priests did all the writing. 

            

            <h2>Facts:</h2> 

            Although hieroglyphics are Egyptian, the word hieroglyphics is Greek. "Hiero" means "holy" and "glyphics" means "marks" or "writings" - so the word means "holy writings". The Egyptians believed there was great power in a name. If someone's name was remembered then he or she would survive in the afterlife. Only roughly 3% of the population of ancient Egypt knew how to read hieroglyphics. <br><br><br><br>
