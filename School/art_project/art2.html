            <h1>Architecture</h1>
            Sun-dried bricks, which were common to Mesopotamia, and architecture that included decorative elements (arches and recessed walls as well as decorations themselves) were adopted into Egypt.

            This is where things like the Step pyramid, which is a structure that uses a series of flat platforms, and the mastaba, Egyptian tombs, began to be used more often for Egypt's elite class.<br> <br><br><br><br>
