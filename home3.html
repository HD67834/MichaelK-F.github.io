        <p id="main">This is a website that I originally created to learn how to develop websites. It was created with the help of my dad in 2020 (lockdown because of covid). You can see the origional website <a href="home.html">here</a>. It was the default apache "It works!" page, with some minor modifications. Later, when I knew a bit more about html, css and javascript I put together <a href="home2.html">this</a>. I had taken the origional website that had been created and took a bootstrap example page and mashed them together. It was a giant mess when trying to make any modifications, and the amount of errors in the console speaks for its self. This was also around the time that I moved the site off my Raspberry Pi 4 and onto <a href="github.com">Github</a>. Moving the site meant getting rid of the chat room, as it was made in php, but that was probably for the better considering the security risks. It was around this time that I lost interest in the site and stoped making large updates to it, only adding small webpages for school. I then moved across the world, whitch meant that I did not have as much time as I would have liked to work on this website - until now. The homepage has just been rebuilt and many other pages will come soon. Hopefully I can make this look better than it did before.
